The given work is devoted to the development of software for the analysis of intracellular action potentials of cardiomyocytes.
The software is developed using Python programming language. The application architecture is based on the principles of object-oriented programming. The use of libraries, such as Tkinter, NumPy, SciPy, and others enabled the development of an application for the analysis of electrophysiological parameters, featuring an intuitive graphical interface. It includes the calculation of amplitude-temporal characteristics of action potentials with minimized subjective factors, convenient data visualization, and export of results in ".xlsx" format for subsequent statistical processing. The program has been successfully tested on data from microelectrode intracellular recordings of action potentials of rat cardiomyocytes, confirming the effectiveness of the developed software in electrophysiological research.
The developed application has potential for further development as it is not limited to the analysis of cardiomyocyte action potentials and can be adapted for processing other biopotentials with similar morphology.
